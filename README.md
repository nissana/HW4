### Facebook

Week 4 Project for the [CodePath](http://www.codepath.com/) course [iOS Bootcamp for designers] (http://codepath.com/iosfordesigners).

Use Xcode to implement some interactions in Facebook including animations/gestures to transition between screens. 

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:
* [x] Required: 
 + Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
 + Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
 +  On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
 + If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
 
* [x] Optional: 
 + The full screen photo should be zoomable.
 + The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.

Walkthrough of all user stories:
